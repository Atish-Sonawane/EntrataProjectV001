# Entrata Automation Framework

The Maven project is designed for automating functionalities on the "entrata.com" website using Selenium. It incorporates organized test cases, Extent Reports for detailed reporting, and logging to track the program flow. Employing the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern enhances code maintainability by encapsulating page elements and actions into dedicated classes. The integration of Maven's dependency management ensures project structure, while Extent Reports facilitate comprehensive result analysis. The addition of logging enhances debugging capabilities, providing a detailed record of the execution sequence. This comprehensive framework offers a robust solution for automated testing on "entrata.com," enabling efficient functionality validation with clear reporting and logging features.
